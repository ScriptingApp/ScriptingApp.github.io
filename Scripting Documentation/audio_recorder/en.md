The `AudioRecorder` class allows you to record audio data to a file. It provides functionalities to start, stop, pause, and manage audio recordings, with configurable settings for audio quality, sample rate, format, and more.

## Features
- Record audio from the systemâ€™s active input device.
- Record for a specified duration or until manually stopped.
- Pause and resume recordings.
- Delete recorded audio files.

## Usage

### Setup SharedAudioSesion
Before create an AudioRecorder instance, we need to setup the `SharedAudioSession`, the audio session is hardware-related and should be properly activated.

```ts
await SharedAudioSession.setActive(true)
await SharedAudioSession.setCategory(
  "playAndRecord",
  ["defaultToSpeaker"]
)
```

### Creating an AudioRecorder Instance
To create an audio recorder, use the `create` method:

```ts
async function createRecorder() {
  try {
    const filePath = Path.join(
      FileManager.documentsDirectory,
      "recording.m4a"
    )
    const recorder = await AudioRecorder.create(filePath, {
      format: "MPEG4AAC",
      sampleRate: 44100,
      numberOfChannels: 2,
      encoderAudioQuality: AVAudioQuality.high
    })
    return recorder
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to create recorder: ", error)
  }
}
```

### Recording Audio
You can start recording using the `record()` method:

```ts
async function startRecording() {
  const recorder = await createRecorder()
  if (recorder) {
    const success = recorder.record()
    console.log("Recording started: ", success)
  }
}
```

You can also provide options to control when to start recording and for how long:

```ts
function startSynchronizedRecording(recorderOne, recorderTwo) {
  let timeOffset = recorderOne.deviceCurrentTime + 0.01
  
  // Synchronize the recording time of both recorders.
  recorderOne.record({ atTime: timeOffset })
  recorderTwo.record({ atTime: timeOffset })
}
```

### Pausing and Stopping the Recording
To pause a recording:

```ts
function pauseRecording(recorder) {
  recorder.pause()
  console.log("Recording paused.")
}
```

To stop a recording:

```ts
function stopRecording(recorder) {
  recorder.stop()
  console.log("Recording stopped.")
}
```

### Deleting a Recording
To delete the recorded file:

```ts
function deleteRecording(recorder) {
  const success = recorder.deleteRecording()
  console.log("Recording deleted: ", success)
}
```

### Disposing of the Recorder
You should call `dispose()` when the recorder is no longer needed to free up resources:

```ts
function disposeRecorder(recorder) {
  recorder.dispose()
  console.log("Recorder disposed.")
}
```

### Event Handling
You can use the `onFinish` and `onError` callbacks to handle recording completion and errors:

```ts
async function setupRecorder() {
  const recorder = await createRecorder()
  if (recorder) {
    recorder.onFinish = (success) => {
      console.log("Recording finished successfully: ", success)
    }

    recorder.onError = (message) => {
      console.error("Recording error: ", message)
    }
  }
}
```

## API Reference

### `AudioRecorder.create(filePath, settings?)`
Creates an `AudioRecorder` instance with specified settings.
- **filePath** (string): The file system location to record to.
- **settings** (optional object): The audio settings for the recording:
  - **format** (AudioFormat): The format of the audio data. Options: "LinearPCM", "MPEG4AAC", "AppleLossless", "AppleIMA4", "iLBC", "ULaw".
  - **sampleRate** (number): The sample rate in hertz (8000 to 192000).
  - **numberOfChannels** (number): The number of channels (1 to 64).
  - **encoderAudioQuality** (AVAudioQuality): The quality of the audio encoding (from `AVAudioQuality.min` to `AVAudioQuality.max`).

Returns: A `Promise` that resolves with an `AudioRecorder` instance.

### `AudioRecorder.isRecording`
A  boolean indicating whether the recorder is recording.

### `AudioRecorder.currentTime`
The time, in seconds, since the beginning of the recording.

### `AudioRecorder.deviceCurrentTime`
The current time of the host audio device, in seconds.

### `AudioRecorder.record(options?)`
Starts recording audio.
- **options** (optional object): Recording options:
  - **atTime** (number): The time at which to start recording, relative to `deviceCurrentTime`.
  - **duration** (number): The duration of the recording, in seconds.

Returns: A boolean indicating whether recording started successfully.

### `AudioRecorder.pause()`
Pauses the current recording.

### `AudioRecorder.stop()`
Stops recording and closes the audio file.

### `AudioRecorder.deleteRecording()`
Deletes the recorded audio file.

Returns: A boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful.

### `AudioRecorder.dispose()`
Releases resources used by the recorder.

### `AudioRecorder.onFinish`
Callback function invoked when the recording finishes.
- **success** (boolean): Indicates whether the recording finished successfully.

### `AudioRecorder.onError`
Callback function invoked when an encoding error occurs.
- **message** (string): Describes the error.

## Example Usage
```ts
import { Path } from 'scripting'

async function run() {

  await SharedAudioSession.setActive(true)
  await SharedAudioSession.setCategory(
    "playAndRecord",
    ["defaultToSpeaker"]
  )

  try {
    const filePath = Path.join(
      FileManager.documentsDirectory,
      "recording.m4a"
    )
    const recorder = await AudioRecorder.create(filePath, {
      format: "MPEG4AAC",
      sampleRate: 48000,
      numberOfChannels: 2,
      encoderAudioQuality: AVAudioQuality.high
    })

    recorder.onFinish = (success) => console.log("Recording finished successfully: ", success)
    recorder.onError = (message) => console.error("Recording error: ", message)

    recorder.record()
    setTimeout(() => {
      recorder.stop()
    }, 5000) // Stop recording after 5 seconds
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error: ", String(error))
  }
}

run()
```

Use the `AudioRecorder` class to easily manage audio recording operations in your scripts, providing flexibility and control over the audio recording process.
