# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to Scripting! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use our app.

## No Data Collection

The Scripting app does not collect or store any personal data. All activities and data generated through the app remain on your device.

## Voluntary Communication

If you choose to contact us via email, we may receive and store the information you provide, such as your name, email address, and any message content. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and will not be shared with third parties.

## Third-Party Integrations

The Scripting app may interact with third-party services, such as the Shortcuts app or other integrations on your device. Any data shared through these integrations is managed entirely by those services and is not collected by us.

When you use Third-Party Model Integration features, the provided API Key is stored locally on the device and is only used to send and receive requests to the AI model for your tasks. The app does not collect, transmit, or use the API Key for any other purpose.

## Health Data and HealthKit

Scripting provides an optional interface to Apple’s HealthKit framework, allowing scripts you write to read from and write to your Health data on device. We respect your privacy and have designed this feature so that:

### No Storage or Analysis

Scripting does not collect, transmit, analyze, or store any of your HealthKit data. All health-related operations occur entirely within your device.

### User Control & Consent

Access to your Health data is controlled by you. Whenever a script requests permission to read or write HealthKit samples, iOS will prompt you to grant or deny that permission. You remain in full control and can revoke access at any time in your system Settings.

### Script-Only Access

HealthKit permissions granted are scoped only to the scripts you run within Scripting. Neither the app itself nor its developers can access your Health data outside of those scripts.

### Transparency

Any script that uses HealthKit APIs must explicitly request the types of data it needs. You can review those requests before granting permission, ensuring you know exactly which health metrics are involved.

## Data Security

As the Scripting app does not collect or store data, there is no risk of unauthorized access to your personal information. Any data shared voluntarily via email will be handled with care and securely stored.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.
