## Use Cases

* **Reproductive Health Apps**: Use types like `menstrualFlow`, `ovulationTestResult`, `pregnancy`, and `lactation` to help users track fertility and cycles.
* **Mindfulness and Lifestyle**: Use `mindfulSession`, `handwashingEvent`, and `toothbrushingEvent` for promoting daily habits.
* **Sleep and Heart Monitoring**: Use `sleepAnalysis`, `sleepApneaEvent`, and heart rhythm-related types to provide nighttime and cardiovascular insights.
* **Symptom Trackers**: Use symptom-related types (e.g., `fatigue`, `fever`, `nausea`) in journaling, recovery, or diagnostics support apps.

## Example: Save a Sleep Stage Sample

```ts
const sample = HealthCategorySample.create({
  type: "sleepAnalysis",
  startDate: new Date("2025-07-03T22:30:00"),
  endDate: new Date("2025-07-04T06:30:00"),
  value: HealthCategoryValueSleepAnalysis.asleepDeep
})

await Health.saveCategorySample(sample)
```

---

## Example: Query Mindful Sessions

```ts
const results = await Health.queryCategorySamples({
  type: "mindfulSession",
  startDate: new Date("2025-07-01"),
  endDate: new Date("2025-07-05")
})

for (const session of results) {
  console.log("From", session.startDate, "to", session.endDate)
}
```

## Notes

* The `value` provided to a category sample must match the expected enum for the given `type`.
* If the `value` does not match the required category value type, the `create()` method will return `null`.
* Samples must span at least one second (`endDate > startDate`).
