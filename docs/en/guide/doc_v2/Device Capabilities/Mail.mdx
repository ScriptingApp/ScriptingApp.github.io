# Mail 

The `Mail` module allows your script to present a native mail compose view, enabling users to send emails with recipients, subject, body, and attachments prefilled. It also provides a way to check whether the device is capable of sending emails.

---

## `Mail.isAvailable: boolean`

Returns `true` if the device is configured to send emails using the built-in Mail app.

```ts
if (!Mail.isAvailable) {
  console.log("Mail is not available on this device.")
}
```

---

## `Mail.present(options): Promise<"cancelled" | "sent" | "failed" | "saved">`

Presents the system mail composer with the provided options. Users can edit the message, then send, cancel, or save it as a draft.

* `"failed"` – Sending failed due to an error (e.g., no email account configured).
* `"saved"` – The email was saved as a draft.

### Throws

This method will throw an error if:

* `Mail.isAvailable` is `false`
* The options are malformed or missing required fields

---

## Example: Simple Email

```ts
if (Mail.isAvailable) {
  const result = await Mail.present({
    toRecipients: ["user@example.com"],
    subject: "Hello from script",
    body: "This email was sent using the Scripting app!"
  })

  console.log("Result:", result) // sent, cancelled, failed, or saved
}
```

---

## Example: Email with Attachment

```ts
const fileData = Data.fromString("Here is the content of the attached file.")

if (Mail.isAvailable) {
  const result = await Mail.present({
    toRecipients: ["user@example.com"],
    subject: "Document attached",
    body: "Please find the document attached.",
    attachments: [
      {
        data: fileData,
        mimeType: "text/plain",
        fileName: "notes.txt"
      }
    ]
  })

  if (result === "sent") {
    console.log("Email successfully sent.")
  } else {
    console.log("Email not sent:", result)
  }
}
```

## Notes

* The system mail composer must be presented in an interactive context (not in background-only scripts).
* The user controls the final sending of the message.
* This API requires a properly configured mail account.
